# HW4 Mbed BLE programming - Peripheral in mbed-os (stm32) and Central in Python (RPi)

## Experiment Instruction

1. New an empty Embed project, replace `main.cpp` and `mbed_app.json`
2. Run the Mbed program on STM32
3. Connect to Raspberry pi, send `rpi.py` and run it
4. Select the device number, service uuid, char uuid, then one will see the result from STM32

## Result (On Rpi)
We can see the data of magnetometer in x, y, z, x, y, z, ... order
